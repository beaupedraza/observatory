Observatory is a project designed to assist in finding detailed information for domains, queries, and “entities” - business, objects, etc.

Features I’d like to have in place (many of these are already possible with current build):

Toggles:

Site:search by domain AND Protocol/WWW filtering (for subdomains and mishandled site migrations)
Open directory detection
PII by filetype
XSS and Malware detection
???
